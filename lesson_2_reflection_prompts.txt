What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/Paul/version-control/reflections/.git/

	On branch master

	Initial commit

	Untracked files:
	  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	No commits are done when you first initialize a repository. Typing git status will show you any files that are untracked

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	An empty repository is created, which contains no commits. It works that way so that it won't automatically include files you actually don't want to keep track of. You need to initialize a repository so you can add files and commit files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	Staging area is the preparation area for files to be committed. Only files in this area are going to be included in the commit executed next time. It helps to divide changes in the working directory into several commits, each of which consists of a group of changes that represent a logical change to the relevant files.
