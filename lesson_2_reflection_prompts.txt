What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/Paul/version-control/reflections/.git/

On branch master

Initial commit

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

No commits are done when you first initialize a repository. Typing git status will show you any files that are untracked
